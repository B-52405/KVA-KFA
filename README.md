# Normal Assumption and Less Injection Lead to Higher Recovery: Volumetric injection attack Evolves Step by Step

Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) schemes allow queries to be performed on encrypted databases, enabling users to retrieve encrypted data without revealing the data content and query keywords to the cloud server. However, due to inherent design constraints and practical considerations, SSE systems inevitably exhibit information leakage that may compromise query privacy. Existing solutions mitigate access pattern and search pattern leakage through efficiency-bandwidth tradeoffs, yet remain vulnerable to sophisticated attacks exploiting volume pattern leakage. In this work, we propose two new file injection attacks, KVA and KFA, that exploit volume pattern leakage and leaked documents or similar documents through innovative grouping strategies and binary-encoded injection techniques. Our methodology allows the attacker to achieve better results with less injection, and to consistently recover up to 93\% of all queries that can be recovered correctly. Notably, our attacks demonstrate resilience against threshold countermeasure commonly deployed in SSE implementations. Through comprehensive simulations on real-world datasets replicating practical leakage scenarios, we establish substantial performance improvements over existing attacks. Experimental results reveal that our attack outperforms other existing attacks in terms of recovery rate, and also has an advantage over the same type of attacks in terms of injection volume.
